# Project: Copy of Public ScriptCache

This Google Apps Script project is named "Copy of Public ScriptCache". Based on its name, it is likely intended to provide some form of caching mechanism within the Google Apps Script environment.

## Overview

The project's primary purpose, as suggested by its name, is to implement or utilize a caching system. This could involve storing and retrieving data to improve performance or reduce API calls.

## Functionality

**Note:** No `.js` or `.html` code files were found in the project directory (`1-0bJIb3TYc29MosGWLbTUl12TuVC7_W_BccV_moQwZX9HXqR8bnb6wcs/`). Therefore, a detailed description of its core functionality and code snippets cannot be provided at this time. It is possible that this project serves as a placeholder, or its code is managed in a non-standard way, or it is a library that is only referenced.

## Web Interface

This project does not appear to be a web application, as there is no `webapp` configuration in its `appsscript.json` file. It is likely a standalone script or a library.

## Permissions

As this is not a web app, the typical `access` and `executeAs` properties are not applicable. For standalone Google Apps Scripts, permissions are generally determined by who has access to the script editor in Google Drive. Users with editor access can run the script manually or configure triggers for its execution.

## Configuration

-   **Time Zone**: The project's time zone is set to `America/New_York`.
-   **Dependencies**: No external libraries are explicitly listed as dependencies in `appsscript.json`.
