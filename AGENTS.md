# Instructions for AI Agents

This repository is intended to gather all my Google Apps Script project files.

## General Guidelines:
1.  **Respect Existing Structure:** Each Google Apps Script project resides in its own directory, named after its Script ID (e.g., `1_SuiFIOR_EKToX4e2h8Jp3IEi8iSlJBnH24i2zQZSq2ETXDRTHXsQps3/`). Do not alter this structure.
2.  **File Naming:** Within each project directory, maintain the original file names as they appear in the Google Apps Script editor (e.g., `Code.js`, `appsscript.json`, `index.html`).
3.  **Clasp Integration:** This repository uses `clasp` for managing Google Apps Script projects. Assume `clasp` is the primary tool for pushing/pulling code.
4.  **No Direct Editing of `clasp-list.json` or `clasp-list.txt`:** These files are generated by scripts and should not be manually edited.
5.  **Python Scripts:** There are several Python scripts (`clasp-pull.py`, `create_missing_scriptid_dirs.py`, `directories.py`, `manifest.py`, `parse_clasp_list.py`, `gas-project-finder.json`) that automate various tasks. Understand their purpose before making changes that might affect their functionality.
6.  **README.md:** The main `README.md` at the root of the repository provides general information about the project. Keep it updated if significant changes occur.
7. Use temporary file such as commit_message.txt for detailed commit message.

## Repository Directory Structure Overview:

-   **Root Directory (`/`):** Contains core configuration files (`.gitignore`, `clasp-list.json`, `clasp-list.txt`), Python utility scripts (`clasp-pull.py`, `create_missing_scriptid_dirs.py`, etc.), and the main `README.md`.
-   **Project Directories (`/{SCRIPT_ID}/`):** Each subdirectory named after a Google Apps Script project's Script ID. These contain the project's source files (e.g., `Code.js`, `appsscript.json`, `index.html`, `deployments.json`, `README.md`).
-   **Hidden Directories (`/.git/`, `/.github/`, `/.gemini/`, `/.gemini_tmp/`):** Standard version control, CI/CD, and agent-specific temporary directories.

## Specific Tasks for Agents:

### Task 1: Syncing Projects
- When asked to sync projects, use `clasp-pull.py` to pull all projects.
- If new projects are added, ensure their directories are created using `create_missing_scriptid_dirs.py`.

### Task 2: Code Modifications
- When modifying code within a specific Google Apps Script project:
    - Locate the correct project directory by its Script ID.
    - Identify the relevant file(s) (e.g., `Code.js`, `appsscript.json`).
    - Apply changes, adhering to the existing coding style and conventions of that specific project.
    - After modification, use `clasp push` from within the project directory to deploy changes.

### Task 3: Project Creation/Deletion
- **Creation:** If a new project needs to be added, the user will provide the Script ID. Create a new directory with this ID and initialize it with `clasp create --type standalone --scriptId <SCRIPT_ID>`.
- **Deletion:** If a project needs to be removed, delete its directory and ensure it's removed from any relevant lists (e.g., `clasp-list.json` if it were manually managed, but it's not, so just the directory).

## UI/UX Guidelines for Web Pages:

1.  **Favicon:**
    -   Use `gold_green.webp` (ensure correct path, e.g., relative to `moukaeritai-pictgram/`) as the default site icon.
    -   When linking to `moukaeritai.work`, ensure the link uses the correct favicon associated with `moukaeritai.work`.
2.  **Top Right Navigation:**
    -   Include links to `moukaeritai.work` and `gas.moukaeritai.work` in the top right corner of the page.
    -   Include a link to `https://github.com/codespaces`.
    -   Style these links to look like buttons.
3.  **Footer Information:**
    -   The footer must state the author's name: **Takashi Sasaki**.
    -   Include a link to the author's homepage: `x.com/TakashiSasaki`.

## Important Considerations:
- **Error Handling:** Be robust in handling errors, especially during `clasp` operations.
- **User Confirmation:** For destructive actions (e.g., deleting projects, pushing major changes), always ask for user confirmation.
- **Logging:** Log important actions and their outcomes.
